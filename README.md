# HW4-Pandas

Please note that when I submitted HW#3, GitHub gave me an error trying to load the data. When I discussed with Michael, he said that it would be fine for me to set up my HW with the resources folder containing the csv parallel to my HW submission since the TAs have the data.  Thanks!

Based on my observations of the data, the following three things were noted:
1)	There were four items that were sold at different price points (i.e. Item ID was different);
2)	While males were the large demographic, females spent more on average for purchases; and
3)	The second most popular age demographic was 15-19 year olds.
